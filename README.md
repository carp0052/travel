####Design Criteria
* Use icons from the iconic icon set - [http://www.somerandomdude.com/work/open-iconic/](http://www.somerandomdude.com/work/open-iconic/) or another open source set of fonts like [http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/) - Give credit to the icons you pick within the header comments for your CSS file.
* Use one icon for the city fields
* Use a second icon beside the date fields
